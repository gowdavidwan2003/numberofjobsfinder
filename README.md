# numberofjobsfinder
This is a Python script that uses the Selenium library to scrape job postings from a given URL. The script opens a Chrome browser, navigates to the specified URL, and scrolls down the page to load all job postings. It then extracts the location of each job posting and counts the number of job openings in each location.
